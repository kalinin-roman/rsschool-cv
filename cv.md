Kata "Vowel one" from CODEWARS

Write a function that takes a string and outputs a strings of 1's and 0's where vowels become 1's and non-vowels become 0's.

All non-vowels including non alpha characters (spaces,commas etc.) should be included.

```
function vowelOne(s){
  // ...
  
  let result = '';
  let a = s.toLowerCase().split('');
  
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if ( a[i] === 'a' || 
        a[i] === 'e' ||
        a[i] === 'o' || 
        a[i] === 'u' ||
        a[i] === 'i' 
       ) {
      result += '1';
    } else {
      result += '0';
    }
  }
  return result;
}
